# Housing_Price_Prediction_MachineLearning
This project aims to build and compare multiple machine learning models to accurately predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, presence of amenities (e.g., guestroom, basement, hot water heating), location preferences, and furnishing status.
